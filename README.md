# -How-to-watch-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-Round-1-


 Volkanovski commenced the contest for UFC 314 on Saturday, April 12, 2025, at the Kaseya Center in Miami, Florida. This fight is for the vacant UFC featherweight title left behind by Ilia Topuria’s move to the lightweight division.
Fight Overview
Alexander Volkanovski: The ex-featherweight champion (26-4 record) is looking to win his belt back after losing it to Ilia Topuria at UFC 298 in February 2024. Volkanovski has been sidelined for more than a year since suffering consecutive KO defeats to Topuria and Islam Makhachev. Still, he had defended the belt five times during his reign, making him one of the most successful fighters in the division.
Diego Lopes: The Brazilian challenger (26-6 record) comes into this fight on a (quite) five-fight winning streak, with wins over prominent names such as Brian Ortega and Dan Ige. Lopes now boasts significant punching power and has not only shown his willingness and ability to absorb punches, but to press the action; two elements that make him a dangerous opponent for Volkanovski. It will be his first title fight in the UFC.
Key Factors
Volkanovski Experience: A past champion with multiple title defenses, Volkanovski’s fight IQ and cardio advantage in the championship rounds. And some concern about his durability after recently being knocked out.
Lopes’ Momentum: Lopes is on a beautiful run and enters this fight with a ton of confidence. His punching power and aggression can create problems for Volkanovski early.
Cardio and Strategy: If Lopes can’t get an early finish, Volkanovski’s stamina and knack for making adjustments in the middle of a fight should tip things in his direction.
Betting Odds
Bookmakers have Volkanovski at a slight (-125) favorite with Lopes a close (+105) underdog.
